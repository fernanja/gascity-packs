This is the `build-from-plan-base` planning handoff step.

Validate that the approved requirements artifact exists at
`{{requirements_path}}` and that artifact_root {{artifact_root}},
context_path {{context_path}}, plan_path {{plan_path}}, and
plan_review_path {{plan_review_path}} are safe plain paths. Record the selected
planning_formula {{planning_formula}} for downstream traceability.

Do not run decomposition or implementation from this step. Record
`gc.build.continuation_entrypoint=plan` when this suffix is launched directly.
Close only after the plan stage can write or reuse the selected plan artifact.

Validating inputs: every artifact this step reads is validated with the
pinned validator's command line, never by eye and never with a guessed
entrypoint or schema id (gc-0dbwj9). The id is the `schema` field below, not
the file name, and the full table with the command is
`assets/workflows/artifact-validation.md` in the pinned pack:

| Artifact file | `--schema` id |
| --- | --- |
| `requirements.md` | `gc.build.requirements.v1` |
| `implementation-plan.md` | `gc.build.plan.v1` |
| `plan-review.md` | `gc.build.plan_review.v1` |
| `decomposition.md` | `gc.build.decomposition.v1` |
| `task-<bead-id>-summary.md`, `implementation-summary.md` | `gc.build.implementation-summary.v1` |
| `review.md`, re-review reports | `gc.build.review.v1` |
| `final-report.md`, `factory-run.md` | `gc.build.final-report.v1` |

```bash
python3 "$(gc formula list --json | python3 -c 'import json,os,sys; c=[os.path.join(os.path.dirname(p),"assets/scripts/validate_build_artifact.py") for p in json.load(sys.stdin)["search_paths"]]; print([p for p in c if os.path.isfile(p)][-1])')" --schema <id from the table> --path <artifact file>
```

Exit 0 (`{"ok": true}`) is valid; exit 1 prints one `error:` line naming the
first problem, which goes into the stop record verbatim.

## Closing this gate

This step is a gate in the build's planning scope and carries
`gc.on_fail=abort_scope`. Its own `gc.outcome` decides whether the build
continues, so always set it before closing. A bead closed with no
`gc.outcome`, or with any value other than `pass`, counts as a failure and
stops the build.

**Validation passed.** Run
`gc bd update "<claimed-step-id>" --set-metadata "gc.outcome=pass"`, then
`gc bd close "<claimed-step-id>" --reason "<what was validated>"`.

**Validation failed.** Do not pass, and do not start or repair the work this
gate guards. Record the stop on the workflow root first. The root id is
`gc.root_bead_id` on this step bead:

```bash
gc bd update "<workflow-root-id>" \
  --set-metadata "gc.build.status=blocked" \
  --set-metadata "gc.build.blocked_step=prepare-plan" \
  --set-metadata "gc.failure_class=<class from the table>" \
  --set-metadata "gc.restart.entrypoint=<entrypoint from the table>" \
  --set-metadata "gc.restart.reason=<one machine-readable clause>"
```

| What failed | `gc.failure_class` | `gc.restart.entrypoint` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The requirements artifact at `{{requirements_path}}` is missing or its status is not approved | `requirements_not_approved` | `build-from-plan` |
| A path input is unsafe or unusable | `plan_inputs_invalid` | `build-from-plan` |

Restart at `build-from-plan` with a corrected `requirements_path` or corrected
paths: this entrypoint consumes requirements, it does not write them.

Then close this step as failed:
`gc bd update "<claimed-step-id>" --set-metadata "gc.outcome=fail"`, then
`gc bd close "<claimed-step-id>" --reason "<what failed and where to restart>"`.
The engine skips the planning steps that have not run, and the implementation
drain closes without dispatching any work. `prepare-review` then ends the
build without a review, and `finalize` runs once. Finalize writes the blocked
report from what this step recorded, so the values above are what the next
person restarts from.
