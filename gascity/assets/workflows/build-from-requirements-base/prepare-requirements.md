This is the `build-from-requirements-base` requirements handoff step.

Validate artifact_root {{artifact_root}}, context_path {{context_path}},
requirements_path {{requirements_path}}, interaction_mode {{interaction_mode}},
and the selected planning formula {{planning_formula}} before requirements work
starts.

Record `gc.build.continuation_entrypoint=requirements` when this suffix is
launched directly. Close only after the requirements stage can write or reuse
the selected requirements artifact.

## Closing this gate

This step is a member of the build scope with `gc.on_fail=abort_scope`. Its own
`gc.outcome` decides whether the build continues, so always set it before
closing. A bead closed with no `gc.outcome`, or with any value other than
`pass`, counts as a failure and stops the build.

**Validation passed.** Run
`gc bd update "<claimed-step-id>" --set-metadata "gc.outcome=pass"`, then
`gc bd close "<claimed-step-id>" --reason "<what was validated>"`.

**Validation failed.** Do not pass, and do not start or repair the work this
gate guards. Record the stop on the workflow root first. The root id is
`gc.root_bead_id` on this step bead:

```bash
gc bd update "<workflow-root-id>" \
  --set-metadata "gc.build.status=blocked" \
  --set-metadata "gc.build.blocked_step=prepare-requirements" \
  --set-metadata "gc.failure_class=<class from the table>" \
  --set-metadata "gc.restart.entrypoint=<entrypoint from the table>" \
  --set-metadata "gc.restart.reason=<one machine-readable clause>"
```

| What failed | `gc.failure_class` | `gc.restart.entrypoint` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A launch input is missing, unsafe, or not in the methodology vocabulary | `requirements_inputs_invalid` | `build-from-requirements` |

Then close this step as failed:
`gc bd update "<claimed-step-id>" --set-metadata "gc.outcome=fail"`, then
`gc bd close "<claimed-step-id>" --reason "<what failed and where to restart>"`.
The engine skips every later build step and runs `finalize` once. Finalize
writes the blocked report from what this step recorded, so the values above
are what the next person restarts from.
